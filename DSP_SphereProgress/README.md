Dyson Sphere Program Mods originally developed by zhangxp1998

~This mod is originally developed by thisisbrad~ I forked it, added Dyson Sphere Save/Load functionalities and removed functionality of the original mod(which means this is pretty much a completely new mod).

**Do not report problems to the developers** when running any of these mods (or even a savegame you've used one of these mods in). The game currently does not support mods. The devs do not need spurious bug reports caused by a modded game. Reproduce your bug on a 100% vanilla game and save, or assume it's potentially related to a mod unless you know with 100% certainty it wasn't influenced in any way by any mod you have installed now or in the past. 


## Sphere Progress
~Adds progress information to the Dyson Sphere UI screen~

Sphere Progress functionality is removed from this mod. Use the original [Sphere Progress Mod](https://dsp.thunderstore.io/package/thisisbrad/SphereProgress/) for that.

## Dyson Sphere Blueprint
Press 'S' to save the Dyson Sphere to clipboard, press 'L' to load Dyson Sphere from clipboard. Press 'P' to complete your sphere. When you save/load, no in game notification is sent. Your sphere's data will be silently copied to clipboard.
Loading will only load the design of Dyson Sphere, **loaded sphere will be empty**. **When loading, this mod will also dismantle your current sphere** to avoid any conflicts.
